There are 4 commands you can do in-game:
1. place <tilecode> at <coordinates>
2. replacing tiles (note that this will replace the first tile whichmatches from the left) - replace <tile>
3. save <filename> - will save the current game as a '.save'file under the 'saves' directory. 
4. quit - will exit the game without saving it.So make sure you save first!
5. place-m <tilecodes in sequence or placement seperated by commas> at <corresponding coordinates seperate by commas> - places multiple tiles on the specified locations.

Tile shape and colour code are as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------
|   Colour Code|        Colour|    Shape Code|         Shape|
-------------------------------------------------------------
|             B|          Blue|        Circle|             1|
|             G|         Green|        4-Star|             2|
|             O|        Orange|       Diamond|             3|
|             P|        Purple|        Square|             4|
|             R|           Red|        6-Star|             5|
|             Y|        Yellow|        Clover|             6|
-------------------------------------------------------------
Some basic rules to get you started:
1. Place tiles with matching colour or shape to score points.
2.The more you can string in a row, the more points you get.
3. You cannot place a duplicate tile on the same line.
4. You are only allowed to place multiple tiles on the same line.
5. The game ends when there are no tiles left in the bag and one of the players has ran out of tiles.
